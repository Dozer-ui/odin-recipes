        <h3><em>Are you ready to enjoy all of this goodness?</em></h3>
        <p>Carne con papas translates to english as "meat with potatoes." Though, <em>carne</em> in this instance is better translated as <em>beef</em>. 
        I cannot imagine that this dish would be very appealing if it were made with turkey or chicken, <strong>but you do you!</strong> I became 
        familiar with this dish in my youth. It was a staple cheap meal that <em>fed the masses</em>, or in other words, a big family. <em>Enjoy!</em>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb ground beef or stew meat</li><br>
            <li>4 cups tomatoes (fresh or canned, whatever you like they're going to get blended!)</li><br>
            <li>1 1/2 lbs potatoes (your favorite kind!)</li><br>
            <li>2 cloves garlic</li><br>
            <li>1 cup chicken broth</li><br>
            <li>1/2 cup pasta (elbow macaroni is what I've always used, but any small pasta will do)</li><br>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li><br>
            <li><em><strong>Optional</strong> 1-2 serrano peppers (if you like that <strong>SPICE</strong>!)</em></li><br>
        </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Chop the potatoes into small cubes. (peel if you prefer) If you opted to add serrano peppers you can seed and finely dice them now. </li><br>
            <li>Blend the tomatoes, chicken broth and garlic until smooth. Add some salt! A tsp should do, but its up to you!</li><br>
            <li>Heat a large pot over medium heat and add the beef. Cook until browned.</li><br>
            <li>Add the tomato mixture and bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes. (I have simmered this recipe for a few hours before. In my experience, the longer you simmer beef in stews like this, the better it tastes! Definitely reccomend a longer simmer if you are using stew meat!)</li><br>
            <li>Add the potatoes and simmer 10-15 minutes. The larger your potatoe cubes, the longer they'll need to cook. (If you chose to use serranos add them now!)</li><br>
            <li>Add the pasta and cook for an additional 10 minutes.</li><br>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste.</li><br>
            <li>Enjoy!</li><br>
        </ol>
    <p><em>*Additionally, you can top your bowl with cheese, I usually do! Cheddar, parmesan or something else? It's up to you!</em></p>
