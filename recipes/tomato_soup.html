        <h3>This is the real deal folks.</h3>
        <p>Tomato soup is a classic. However, there are people out there who have <strong>only ever had canned tomato soup</strong>! That's a crime, honestly. This recipe uses canned tomatoes but holy mackeral of gawd is it good! Better yet, if you're a tomato grower, substitute canned for your very own fresh garden tomatoes!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (28 oz) can whole pureed tomatoes (or crushed run through a blender)</li><br>
            <li>2 cloves minced garlic</li><br>
            <li>2 tbs olive oil</li><br>
            <li>2 cups chicken broth</li><br>
            <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li><br>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li><br>
        </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add garlic and saute until fragrant, about 1 minute. <em><strong>DO NOT BURN YOUR GARLIC!</strong></em> It over-cooks pretty quickly.</li><br>
            <li>Add pureed tomatoes, chicken broth and salt and pepper to taste. Heat at medium-high. (If you used fresh tomatoes you can bring this up to a simmer for 10-15 minutes.)</li><br>
            <li>Once it's nice and hot, lower the heat to medium and add cream. Stir until fully incorporated.</li><br>
            <li>Bring to slight simmer, stirring constantly for about 10 minutes.</li><br>
            <li>Now whip up your best grilled cheese and chow down! Also very good with mozzerella sticks!</li><br>
            <li>Enjoy!</li><br>
